# ESP8266-TinyML-test

This repository contains a modified version of the EloquentTinyML library for the ESP8266. 

The official release for the library currently only supports Cortex-M and ESP32. Therefore, this repository was created to increase the compatiability to ESP8266.

This project was tested on the ESP8266 D1 Mini.

I do not own this library. For the official library, please visit: https://github.com/eloquentarduino/EloquentTinyML

Note: This library is NOT latest version (2.4.0).
